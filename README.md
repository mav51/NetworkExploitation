# NetworkExploitation

**ᛝᛝᛝ** This repository stores tools for conducting network attacks. Use them for good purposes and do not destroy other people's networks **ᛝᛝᛝ**

**ᛝᛝᛝ** The repository was created on January 8, 2022. Over time, this repository will be updated and filled with more tools. **ᛝᛝᛝ**

Please, read the source code these scripts before using these tools. 

**You need to know what you're doing.** **Don't be like a script-kiddie!**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**ARPScanner.py** - This scanner is designed to detect "live" hosts on the network. ARP scanning is quite noisy, keep in mind.

**ARPSpoofer.py** - This tool is designed to carry out an ARP-Spoofing attack. It also has the function of restoring ARP tables. And this tool is fully parameterized. Specify the victim's address, gateway and network interface.

**DHCPAbuse.py** - This tool is designed for the abuse of a DHCP server (DHCP Starvation Attack)

**DTPAbuse.py** - This tool is designed to carry out a "VLAN Hopping" attack using the shortcomings of the DTP protocol (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)

**DoSNetwork.py** - This tool generates random MAC addresses and generates random IP packets with subsequent ICMP sending. Running this script may cause the local network to crash. I believe that this script can serve as a kind of "stress test" for your network.

**HSRPHijacking.py** - This tool is designed to attack the HSRP protocol. Become the main router!

**MACFlooder.py** - This tool is designed for abusing the switch table. (CAM Table Overflow Attack)

**STPRootAttack.py** - This tool designed to attack the STP protocol (802.1D). The script will send malicious BPDUs, which will eventually make you a root switch.

**TCPSYNFlooding.py** - This script is designed to carry out a TCP-SYN Flooding attack. The script initiates sending a huge number of TCP SYN segments.
