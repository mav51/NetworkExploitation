# NetworkExploitation

ᛝᛝᛝ This repository stores tools for conducting network attacks. Use them for good purposes and do not destroy other people's networks ᛝᛝᛝ

ᛝᛝᛝ The repository was created on January 8, 2022. Over time, this repository will be refined and updated ᛝᛝᛝ

Please, read the source code these scripts before using these tools. 

You need to know what you're doing. Don't be like a script-kiddie!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARPScanner.py - This scanner is designed to detect "live" hosts on the network. ARP scanning is quite noisy, keep in mind.

DTPabuse.py - This tool is designed to carry out a "VLAN Hopping" attack using the shortcomings of the DTP protocol (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)

DHCPabuse.py - This tool is designed for the abuse of a DHCP server (DHCP Starvation Attack)

MACFlooder.py - This tool is designed for abusing the switch table. (CAM Table Overflow Attack)

STPRootAttack.py - This tool designed to attack the STP protocol. The script will send malicious BPDUs, which will eventually make you a root switch.

DoSNetwork.py - This tool generates random MAC addresses and generates random IP packets with subsequent ICMP sending. Running this script may cause the local network to crash. I believe that this script can serve as a kind of "stress test" for your network.
